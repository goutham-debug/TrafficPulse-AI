# AI-Driven-Early-Warning-System-for-Traffic-Congestion-Hotspots
An intelligent multi-agent system that analyses real-time and historical traffic data to detect early congestion trends before escalation. Built using Langflow and IBM Granite with RAG, it supports proactive, assistive traffic planning and early intervention.
    
🚦 AI-Driven Early Warning System for Traffic Congestion Hotspots
📌 Overview
    An intelligent multi-agent system that proactively detects emerging traffic congestion hotspots by analyzing real-time and historical traffic data. The system     provides early warnings and planning-level advisories to support proactive traffic management.
🎯 Problem Statement
    Traffic congestion hotspots develop gradually due to increasing demand, roadworks, weather, or incidents. Existing systems are reactive and lack early warning      mechanisms. This project addresses the need for predictive congestion detection before escalation.
🧠 Solution Approach
    The system continuously monitors traffic metrics such as vehicle speed, traffic density, and travel time, compares them against historical and seasonal             patterns, and identifies early congestion trends. Planning-level advisories are generated to assist traffic authorities in proactive decision-making.
🏗️ System Architecture
    The solution follows a modular, agent-based architecture:
    Traffic Data Analysis Agent – Processes and normalizes traffic data
    Congestion Risk Detection Agent – Detects early congestion trends
    Decision Agent – Validates severity and prioritizes risks
    Alert & Planning Assistant – Issues assistive early warnings
    Visualization & Reporting Agent – Presents insights for decision support
⚙️ Technology Stack
    Langflow – Multi-agent orchestration
    IBM watsonx.ai (Granite Model) – AI reasoning
    RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) – Congestion management strategies and transport planning guidelines
    Search / External APIs – Contextual traffic information
